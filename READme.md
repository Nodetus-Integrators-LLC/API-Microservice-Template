# API Microservice Template

A production-ready template for building scalable API microservices following best practices and clean architecture principles.

## Core Features

- Modular API routing with versioning
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Database agnostic with support for multiple databases
- Standardized error handling and responses
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Docker and Kubernetes ready
- Testing framework with pytest
- OpenAPI documentation

## Key Components

- **API Layer**: Route definitions and request handling
- **Core**: Application configuration and essential setup
- **Models**: Database structure definitions
- **Schemas**: Data validation and serialization
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and helpers

## Usage

1. Clone template
2. Configure environment variables
3. Add domain-specific models, schemas, and services
4. Implement business logic
5. Run tests and deploy

## Customization Points

- Add new domains under `api/v1/endpoints/`
- Extend models and schemas for specific needs
- Implement custom services
- Configure database connections
- Add middleware as needed

## Best Practices

- Keep endpoints thin
- Move logic to services
- Use dependency injection
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Document interfaces
- Follow test-driven development
